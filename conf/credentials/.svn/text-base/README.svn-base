This folder contains the configuration file with the parameters
to access the ens web service. The file contains essentially 3
parameters: username, password and ENS web service url.

These credentials define the identity of the web application
in relation to the ENS web service.

If your Application server is sitting behind a proxy/firewall,
you can set the ens client to work in this context setting the params:
proxyUrl=your.proxy.it
proxyPort=1234
proxyUser=yourProxy.username
proxyPassword = yourProxyPassword

The setting of the parameters will imply that the ens client will use them.
If don't need to use a proxy, remove all the related configuration.
